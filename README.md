SharpHammer
======

Based on Sledge forked for learning purposes and hopefully turn into a personal level editor.

---

SharpHammer is an open-source alternative to Valve's Hammer Editor for the Goldsource engine.
It is written in .NET and uses [Veldrid][2] for rendering, with DirectX 10.

SharpHammer supports Goldsource mapping but is rather incomplete and buggy
